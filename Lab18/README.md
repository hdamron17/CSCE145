Lab 18 - File I/O
=================

This lab demonstrates file I/O in a grade calculator.

The main source file is `src/Lab18.java` which calculates the averages of a gradebook in a specific format.
It can accept a single argument which is the path to a file to use instead of the default.

The `data/` directory contains several example gradebooks in the proper format.

To compile: `make all`

To run: `make run`

To run with a different file: `make run args=[file path]`
